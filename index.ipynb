        "Resilient: RDDs are considered \"resilient\" because they have built-in fault tolerance. This means that even if one of the nodes goes offline, RDDs will be able to restore the data. This is already a huge advantage compared to standard storage. If a standard computer dies while performing an operation, all of its memory will be lost in the process. With RDDs, multiple nodes can go offline, and the action will still be held in working memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Distributed: The data is contained on multiple nodes of a cluster-computing operation. It is efficiently partitioned to allow for parallelism.\n",

Essentially, when RDDs are created, they are programmed to perform some action, but that function will not get activated until it is explicitly called. The reason for lazy evaluation is that allows users to organize the actions of their Spark program into smaller actions. It also saves unnecessary computation and memory load.\n",
        "- In-Memory: The operations in Spark are performed in-memory rather than in the database. This is what allows Spark to perform fast operations with very large quantities of data.\n",
